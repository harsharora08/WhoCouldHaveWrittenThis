## Who Could Have Written This? â€“ A Neural Network Model that matches entered prompt with artists' styles

A Deep Learning Network Model trained on thousands of lyrics of ten artists, and tells whose style of writing an input prompt matches the most.

## Data Collection

The data was collected from [Genius](https://genius.com/) and the API wrapper used is [Wrap-Genius.](https://github.com/fedecalendino/wrap-genius)

## Data Processing and Model Training

The lyrics were stripped from blanks and duplicates were removed. Resampling was done as per requirements.

Texts were then vectorized and fitted into a neural network model whose summary is as follows
